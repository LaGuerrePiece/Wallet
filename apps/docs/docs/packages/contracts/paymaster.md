# Paymaster

Solidity components for ERC-4337 Paymasters.

A `Paymaster` is similar to [`Extensions`](./wallet.md#extensions). They should be paired with a `Base`, but unlike `Extensions`, you should only use one `Paymaster` per wallet.

:::info

If none of the implementations fit your use case, come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FpXmvKrNed) or [E-mail](mailto:founders@stackup.sh) about getting it built!

Alternatively, the package also exports the minimum interface required to build your own `Paymaster` that is compliant with the spec.

## Minimum viable interface

The minimum interface that must be implemented in order to be a compliant ERC-4337 paymaster.

```solidity
import @PackageName/contracts/ERC4337/paymaster/IERC4337Paymaster.sol;
```

```solidity
enum PostOpMode {
  opSucceeded, // UserOperation succeeded.
  opReverted, // UserOperation reverted, but still have to pay for gas.
  postOpReverted // UserOperation succeeded, but postOp reverted.
}

interface IERC4337Paymaster {
  function validatePaymasterUserOp(
    UserOperation calldata op,
    bytes32 requestId,
    uint256 maxCost
  ) external view returns (bytes memory context);

  function postOp(
    PostOpMode mode,
    bytes calldata context,
    uint256 actualGasCost
  ) external;
}

```

The `validatePaymasterUserOp` function is what get's called by the `EntryPoint` during the [verification phase](../../introduction/erc-4337-overview.md#entrypoint). It has the following arguments:

- [`UserOperation`](./useroperation.md)
- `requestId`: Hash of `UserOperation`, `EntryPoint` address, and `chainId`
- `maxCost`: Max amount of wei that must be staked on the `EntryPoint` to cover gas fees.

If `validatePaymasterUserOp` agrees to sponsor the transaction it will return a `context` that is passed to `postOp` during the [execution phase](../../introduction/erc-4337-overview.md#entrypoint). The `postOp` function has the following arguments:

- `mode`: An enum to check the execution status of the [`UserOperation`](./useroperation.md).
- `context`: Arbitrary data set by `validatePaymasterUserOp` that can be used to run the fee logic.
- `actualGasCost`: The actual amount of wei used for the transaction.

## Implementations

Various implementations of an ERC-4337 paymaster. Use one that matches the fee logic you require. A `Paymaster` will validate a signature in accordance with the [`Base`](./wallet.md#base) used.

### `SimplePaymaster`

If the `requestId` signature is valid, the `Paymaster` will agree to sponsor the `UserOperation` without doing anything else in `postOp`. This could be a good option for apps where the business logic for transaction fees happens either off-chain or through some other mechanism.

```solidity
import @PackageName/contracts/ERC4337/paymaster/SimplePaymaster.sol;
```

```solidity
contract Paymaster is BaseEOAOwner, SimplePaymaster {
  constructor(address entryPoint) BaseEOAOwner(entryPoint) {}
}

```

### `ERC20Paymaster`

:::caution

**ðŸš§ This implementation is still TBD.**
